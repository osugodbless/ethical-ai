## I will use AI when:

- I have tried myself to solve the problem.

- I don't understand how something works and I need to.

- It is important that I explore alternative approaches.

## I will NOT use AI when:

- I haven't tried to solve the problem on my own.

- I am writing an exam or taking an assessment.

- I am still learning fundamental concepts.

## I know I'm using AI fairly when:

- I can explain any code I push, without AI's help.

- I could solve a similar problem without the help of AI.

- I don't get scared of solving problem and more confident in my own understanding.
