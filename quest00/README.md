# Prompt AI

A documentation of my quest to build the right habit to use AI to think and learn deeply, not to skip learning.

## What I Learned About AI and Self-Reliance

Through the different exercises in this quest, I learned that AI is most valuable when it supports my thinking rather than replaces it. Using AI effectively means asking better questions, validating my understanding, and not just copying solutions. I now understand that self-reliance grows when I first attempt problems on my own, struggle through it, and then use AI to clarify any gaps in my reasoning. This approach I believe, is what will help me to build confidence in my problem-solving ability.

## My Main Insight about using AI ethically as a coder

My main insight is that ethical AI use in coding is about **intent and responsibility**. AI should be treated  mainly as a learning assistant, not a shortcut to bypass personal effort or understanding. When we rely on AI to think for us, we weaken our skills; when we use it to challenge ideas, review logic, or expose blind spots, we grow as individuals or developers. Ethical use means being honest about what we understand, accountable for our code, and intentional about learning rather than speed.

## Applying These Principles in Future Quests

In future quests, I plan to apply these principles by attempting tasks independently before running to AI for help. I will critically think about the problem first and try to understand and solve it. The use of AI will be for validating my thoughts. I will focus on understanding fundamental concepts, debugging errors systematically on my own, and learning from mistakes instead of hiding behind generated answers. 

My objective is to strenthen my foundational skills and become dependable as a developer and as an individual.
