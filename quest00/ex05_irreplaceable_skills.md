## Rate yourself (1–5) in each skill and plan improvements:

| Skill | Description | Rating | Improvement Plan |
|------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Problem Decomposition | Breaking down problems logically | 4/5 | I will practice writing problem steps in plain English before coding; outline inputs, outputs, and edge cases first. |
| Systems Thinking | Understanding how components interact | 3/5 | Draw simple diagrams showing how functions, files, and data flow connect in small projects. |
| Critical Evaluation | Knowing when code is wrong or inefficient | 3/5 | Manually trace code execution with sample inputs and compare multiple solution approaches. |
| Debugging Mindset | Investigating unexpected behavior | 4/5 | Use print statements and step-by-step reasoning before searching for external help. |
| Conceptual Understanding | Knowing WHY, not just HOW | 2/5 | Re-explain learned concepts in my own words and teach them to someone else or write summaries. |


## Choose your lowest-rated skill and write 3 specific actions you'll take this week to improve it without relying on AI.

- Rewrite explanations

After learning a new concept, I will write a short explanation in my own words as if teaching a beginner.

- Manual examples

I will take at least one piece of code per day and manually walk through it line by line using pen and paper to understand why it behaves the way it does.

- Concept-first coding

Before writing code, I will clearly state the concept being used (e.g., “this solution uses needs two pointers because…”) to ensure I understand the reasoning behind the approach.
