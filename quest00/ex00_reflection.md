### How have you used AI for coding so far?

I have used AI for learning programming concepts quickly, and sometimes deeply when I am really curious.

### Do you usually try problems yourself first?

Yes I do. Most times I try to solve the problem myself first. Then if I run into errors and I get stuck, I copy the part of the code I suspect the error is coming from and ask AI for help.

### Can you explain code you've submitted without AI's help?

Yes I can.

### What would happen if AI was unavailable during an exam or job test?

I have never relied on AI during an examination or test, so I'll be fine without it.

### My current pattern

Learner B: uses AI as a learning amplifier.

### Write a short paragraph describing where you are today and what type of learner you want to become.

I currently use AI to learn deeply. However, on a few occassions when I'm in a hurry, I have used it to generate answers only. I want to become a learner who only uses it learn deeply and only use generated code I understand perfectly.
