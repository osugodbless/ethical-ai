### Interview: You're asked to explain a caching system design. What happens if you've always relied on AI to design systems?

I wouldn't be ableto explain the design, because AI has been doing the bulk of the work.

### Production Bug: At 2 AM, you must debug code generated by AI months ago - but AI is offline. Can you fix it?

If I didn't study and understand the code before using it, I will not be able to fix it in time.

### New Technology: A new library is released, and AI hasn't been trained on it yet. How do you learn it?

By studying the official documentation of library.

## Reflection: Write one paragraph explaining how using AI fairly today prepares you for real-world challenges like these.

Using AI fairly prepares me for real-world challenges because then I'll be able to solve problems independently without overrelying on AI. It also helps me build my critical thinking ability which i believe is a very important attribute to have in a professional environment.
